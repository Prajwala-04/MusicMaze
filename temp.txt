In this calm world of Weather , we rise and fall,
Whispers of dreams that endlessly call.
The stars align to the rhythm of our fate,
Melodies bloom, it's never too late.
Through shadows and light, we write our song,
In Hindi, where heartbeats belong.
From silent nights to glowing skies,
The music of Weather  never dies.
